We decided to create an Antivirus, a program that scans incoming files and finds out if the file is a virus or infected with Malware.
We aim to scan a specific file which has been downloaded from the internet.
The features we will be deploying in this exercise:

**UPDATE:**
Our Antivirus program will connect to a specific website to update the known hashes.
We will be updating our program from the following site:
[https://virusshare.com/hashes.4n6](https://virusshare.com/hashes.4n6)

**SCAN:**
The Virus scanner will compare the file hash to the built-in, known hashes and will make a determination on the file credibility.
THREAT DETECTION:
This means that the antivirus program can scan your entire computer in search of viruses.

**ANALYSE:**
Analyse suspicious files and URLs to detect types of malware including viruses, worms, and Trojans.


**We will be using the following:**
*	Variables
*	While / For loops
*	If/Else Statements
*	lists
*	Boolean
*	Input and Output
*	Integer
*	String
*	Length
*	Print
